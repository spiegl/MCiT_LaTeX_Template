## How to use

Download the needed zip file form above and start working ðŸ¤—.

I highly recommend to **only edit the normal .tex files and to write the main content in document.tex**, in oder that your work will be updateable!

I recommend to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [LaTeX Workshop Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop). Works fine on Linux, Windows and Mac.
